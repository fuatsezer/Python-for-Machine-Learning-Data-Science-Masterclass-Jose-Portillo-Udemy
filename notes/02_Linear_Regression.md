# Linear Regression 
* Linear Regression OLS Theory
* We know the equation of a simple straight line:
* y = mx + b
  * m is slope 
  * b is intercept with y-axis

* OLS will allow us to directly solve for the slope m and intercept b.
* We will later see we'll need tools like gradient descent to scale this to multiple features.
* Each feature shoukd have some Beta coefficient associated with it.

# Performance Metric
## Root Mean Squared Error
* What is good value for RMSE?
* A RMSE of 10$ is fantastic for predicting the price of a house, but horrible for predicting the price of a candy bar.
